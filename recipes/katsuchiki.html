    <h1>What is katsu?</h1>
    <p>Katsu is a Japanese dish of crispy fried cutlets coated with Panko bread crumbs. <br>Popular varieties are chicken katsu (like this recipe) and tonkatsu (which is made with pork).</p>

    <h2>Ingredients you'll need:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Chicken: </strong>You'll need four skinless, boneless chicken breast halves.</li>
        <li><strong>Seasonings: </strong>This chicken katsu recipe is simply seasoned with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li><strong>Flour: </strong>All-purpose flour helps seal in the moisture, adds flavor, and promotes browning.</li>
        <li><strong>Egg: </strong>An egg adds moisture and gives the Panko something to stick to.</li>
        <li><strong>Panko: </strong>Panko bread crumbs are responsible for katu's signature crunch.</li>
        <li><strong>Oil: </strong>Opt for a neutral oil with a high smoke point, such as canola or vegetable oil.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps: </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Season chicken breasts on both sides with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Place flour, beaten egg, and panko crumbs into separate shallow dishes.</li>
        <li>Coat chicken breasts in flour, shaking off any excess; dip  into egg, and then press into panko crumbs until well coated on both sides.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a largge skillet over medium-high heat. Place chicken in the hot oil, and fry until golden brown, 3 or 4 minutes per side.</li>
        <li>Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3><i>Tip: Try serving this with a Japanese salad dressing for dipping.</i></h3>
